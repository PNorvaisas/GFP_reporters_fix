# GFP_reporters_fix
Reannotation of E. coli transcriptional reporter library (Zaslaver et al. 2006) based on most recent E. coli K-12 genome annotations
- Identification of promoter region amplicons in the most recent E. coli K-12 genome assembly and annotation based on primers provided in the original study using BLAST
- Identification of problematic amplicons and manual error-checking
- Cross-check with RegulonDB
- Linking of amplicons to promoters and their downstream genes
